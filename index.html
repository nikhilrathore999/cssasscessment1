            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
        </li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
        <li><strike>Css is not neccesary</strike> <span class="highlight"> CSS saves a lot of work. </span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
        <li><i><u>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</u></i></li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="color"><i>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</i></h2>
    <ul  class="let"> <font color="brown">
        <li>
            Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elementsl
        </li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files.However, <spam class="highlight"> <b> this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, </b></spam> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
        </font>
    </ul>
    <p class="font">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and itâ€™s used by JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p class="font">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.
    </p>
    <p class="font">There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
